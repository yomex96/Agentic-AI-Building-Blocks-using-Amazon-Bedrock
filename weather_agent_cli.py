You are an expert at working with the National Weather Service (NWS) API.

Your task: Generate the NWS API URL to get weather forecast data for "{location}".

Instructions:
1. First, determine the approximate latitude and longitude coordinates for this location
2. Generate the NWS Points API URL: https://api.weather.gov/points/{{lat}},{{lon}}

For the coordinates, use your knowledge to estimate:
- Major cities: Use well-known coordinates
- ZIP codes: Estimate based on the area
- States: Use approximate center coordinates
- In case a location description is provided instead of a location name, please use the most likely city and state name as the location for the coordinates

Example for Seattle:
https://api.weather.gov/points/47.6062,-122.3321

Example for largest city in USA:
Based on your knowledge, you will establish location is New York City
https://api.weather.gov/points/40.7128,-74.0060

Now generate the API call (Points API) for the established location. 
Return ONLY the complete Points API URL, nothing else.
Format: https://api.weather.gov/points/LAT,LON
