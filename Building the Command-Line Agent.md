Building the Command-Line Agent
Now let's build our AI agent step by step! We'll create a python program that demonstrates all the core agentic AI patterns.

Step 1: Amazon Bedrock Connection (8 minutes)
First, let's create the foundation - connecting to Claude 4.5 Sonnet.

Inside the folder created in the environment setup i.e. agentic-ai-workshop, create a new file called weather_agent_cli.py and add this code:

        print(f"Claude says: {response}")
    else:
        print("❌ Connection failed!")
        print(f"Error: {response}")

Test this code:

Now, in the terminal window, run this:

1
python weather_agent_cli.py

You should see Claude's response confirming the connection works!

🔍 What's Happening Here?
Amazon Bedrock Client: We create a connection to Amazon Bedrock in us-west-2
Model Selection: We specify Claude 4.5 Sonnet as our AI model
Message Format: We structure our prompt in the format Claude expects
Configuration: We set parameters for response length and creativity
Error Handling: We catch and handle any connection issues
Step 2: Building Agent Logic (10 minutes)
IMPORTANT: Make sure to REMOVE the code underneath # Test our connection to Claude from the previous step before pasting the code below!
Now let's add the core agent functionality. Add these functions to your weather_agent_cli.py file:

Instructions:
1. First, determine the approximate latitude and longitude coordinates for this location
2. Generate the NWS Points API URL: https://api.weather.gov/points/{{lat}},{{lon}}

For the coordinates, use your knowledge to estimate:
- Major cities: Use well-known coordinates
- ZIP codes: Estimate based on the area
- States: Use approximate center coordinates
- In case a location description is provided instead of a location name, please use the most likely city and state name as the location for the coordinates

Example for Seattle:
https://api.weather.gov/points/47.6062,-122.3321

Example for largest city in USA:
Based on your knowledge, you will establish location is New York City
https://api.weather.gov/points/40.7128,-74.0060

🔍 Complete Agent Workflow
Our agent now demonstrates the full agentic AI pattern:

Planning: AI analyzes the location and plans the API calls
Action: Agent executes the planned API calls in sequence
Processing: AI analyzes the raw weather data and creates insights
Response: Agent presents results to the user
Test Your Agent!
Now, in the terminal window, run your completed agent:

1
python weather_agent_cli.py

Try these test cases:

"Seattle" (should work well - major city)
"90210" (tests ZIP code recognition)
"New York City" (tests city name variations)
"National park near Homestead in Florida"
"Largest City in California"
Congratulations! You've built a working AI agent that demonstrates all the key agentic AI patterns! 🎉

If you had any issues with the step-by-step code snippets above, here's the complete `weather_agent_cli.py` file for reference:
Next, let's see this same functionality in a beautiful web interface!
